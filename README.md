# GCM-C
## STILL IN WORK !
Basic implementation of GCM encryption algorithm in C from paper: The The Galois/Counter Mode of Operation (GCM) 
1. Done:
- [x] encryption
- [x] generate auth tag
2. In progress:
- [ ] decryption
- [ ] multiplication in GF not working
- [ ] check auth tag

Using PKCS#7 padding
